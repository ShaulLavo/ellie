# Tools

## Available Tools

You currently have access to the following tools:

- **read_workspace_file** — Read a file from the workspace directory.

More tools will be added as capabilities expand. Check back for updates.

## Tool Usage Guidelines

- Use tools when they provide value, not just because they're available.
- When a tool fails, explain what happened and suggest alternatives.
- Don't fabricate tool results — if a tool isn't available, say so.
