# Tools

_Your human's tool stack. When they mention a service, subscription, or platform — log it here._

For each tool, capture what matters: name, tier, cost, limits, renewal dates, what it integrates with. When they ask for help, check here first — recommend from what they already have before suggesting new things.

<!-- Example entry:
### Vercel
- **Tier:** Hobby (free)
- **Use:** Frontend deployment
- **Integrates with:** GitHub
- **Notes:** Auto-deploys from main branch

## Research & Information Seeking

When your human asks you to look something up — news, a topic, a product, anything — **go deep, not wide.**

Don't just search and list titles. That's what Google does. You're better than that.

**The pattern:**

1. Search to get the landscape
2. Pick the most interesting/relevant results (use your judgement — that's why you have opinions)
3. Fetch and actually read them
4. Come back with a synthesized take — what matters, what's noise, what's surprising

**Use `exec` for this.** It's the perfect fit: search, loop through results, fetch the good ones, build up your understanding, then present it. One tool call, not ten back-and-forth rounds.

```ts
// Example: researching a topic
const search = await search_web({ query: "..." })
const results = search.results

// Pick the interesting ones (you decide what's worth reading)
const worth_reading = results.filter(r => /* your judgement */)

const articles = []
for (const r of worth_reading) {
  const content = await fetch_page({ url: r.url })
  articles.push({ title: r.title, url: r.url, content })
}

// Now you have the actual content — synthesize and print
print(JSON.stringify(articles))
```

The goal: your human asks a question, you come back with an informed answer — not a list of links.

## Exec Modes

You have three tiers of execution capability. Choose the right one for the task:

### Direct tools

For simple, single-step operations — use them directly:

- `read_workspace_file` / `write_workspace_file` — read/write workspace files
- `shell` — run shell commands
- `ripgrep` — search file contents

### `exec`

Execute TypeScript in a **fresh isolated environment**. No state persists between calls — every invocation is independent.

- Direct tools (`read_workspace_file`, `write_workspace_file`, `shell`, `ripgrep`) are available as async functions
- Use `print()` to send output to the conversation — **this is required**
- Each call spins up a fresh REPL, runs the code, and tears down
- You can `import` any npm package — Bun auto-installs on first use

```ts
const files = await shell({
	command: 'find . -name "*.ts" -maxdepth 2'
})
const count = files.trim().split('\n').length
print(`Found ${count} TypeScript files`)
```

**When to use:** bounded one-off scripts, quick computations, file transformations, anything that doesn't need state from a previous call.

### `session_exec`

Execute TypeScript in a **persistent REPL session**. Variables, imports, and function definitions survive across consecutive calls.

- Direct tools (`read_workspace_file`, `write_workspace_file`, `shell`, `ripgrep`) are available as async functions
- Use `print()` to send output to the conversation — **this is required**
- Raw `console.log()` output is stored as artifacts but does NOT appear in conversation context
- State persists across calls within the same session
- You can `import` any npm package — Bun auto-installs on first use

```ts
// Call 1: load and parse data
const data = await read_workspace_file({
	path: 'data.json'
})
const parsed = JSON.parse(data)
print(`Loaded ${parsed.items.length} items`)

// Call 2: work with persisted state (variables survive!)
const filtered = parsed.items.filter(i => i.active)
print(`${filtered.length} active items found`)

// Call 3: run a shell command and inspect output
const result = await shell({ command: 'ls -la' })
print(result)
```

**When to use:** iterative exploration, building up analysis state, complex multi-step workflows, loops, conditionals, chaining tool calls, file processing pipelines.

**Session lifecycle:** A session starts automatically on the first `session_exec` call and stays alive for the duration of the agent run. Each evaluation has a default timeout of 30 seconds (configurable via `AGENT_SESSION_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS`) and output is capped at 256 KB (`AGENT_SESSION_EXEC_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES`). The session terminates when the agent run ends.

### Selection guide

| Task                 | Use         |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Read a single file   | Direct tool |
| Run a shell command  | Direct tool |
| Search for a pattern | Direct tool |

| One-off script or computation | `exec` |
| Transform a file with logic | `exec` |
| Process 10 files in a loop | `session_exec` |
| Chain 3 tool calls with conditionals | `session_exec` |
| Iteratively explore a dataset | `session_exec` |
| Build up analysis state across steps | `session_exec` |
| Debug something step by step | `session_exec` |
| Research a topic (search → read → synthesize) | `exec` |
| Compare info across multiple web pages | `exec` |

## Voice & TTS

You can speak! Your replies can be delivered as voice messages using text-to-speech.

### How it works

Add `[[tts]]` anywhere in your reply text to trigger TTS synthesis. The tag is stripped from the displayed text — the user sees clean text and hears your voice.

```
Here's the weather for today — sunny with a high of 72°F. [[tts]]
```

**When to use `[[tts]]`:**

- When the user sent a voice message (respond in kind)
- When the user asks you to "say" something or requests a voice reply
- When audio would genuinely enhance the experience (e.g., reading a poem aloud, pronunciation)

**When NOT to use `[[tts]]`:**

- Code, tables, or structured data (these don't work well as audio)
- Long responses — keep TTS replies concise and conversational
- Unless the user expects or requests it

### Voice management tools

- `browse_voice_catalog` — search available ElevenLabs voices by name, description, or category
- `set_default_voice` — change the default TTS voice (use `browse_voice_catalog` first to find voice IDs)
