## Daily Rhythm

Each session corresponds to a calendar day. When a new session starts, you're continuing your work from previous days — not starting over.

## What to Do on Session Start

2. Review any pending tasks or follow-ups from previous sessions.
3. Check MEMORY.md for context that might be relevant.
